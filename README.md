# Iono RP

Choose your favorite way of programming your [Iono RP](https://www.sferalabs.cc/product/iono-rp/):

### MicroPython
The flexibility of the Python language, plus an interactive prompt (the REPL) to execute commands on the fly, optimized to run on microcontrollers.    
Go to the [micropython directory](./micropython).

### Arduino 
If you are familiar with the Arduino IDE or want to re-use code written for [Iono Uno](https://www.sferalabs.cc/product/iono-uno/) or [Iono MKR](https://www.sferalabs.cc/product/iono-mkr/) check out [this repository](https://github.com/sfera-labs/iono), which includes many examples and ready-to-use applications, like the [Modbus RTU Slave app](https://github.com/sfera-labs/iono/wiki/Modbus-RTU-Slave).

### C/C++
For low level, highly optimized programming and access to all the functionalities of the native Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK, go to the [c directory](./c).
